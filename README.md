# DnDTables
DnDTables is a companion app for the popular Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) game. This app was created on Solar2d with one contributing developer.

DnDTables has some handy reference tables to eliminate the need to thumb through a few of the books.

All the referenced material is for the 5e edition of DnD. There is also an Initiative Tracker for DM's.

The character sheet auto populates as stats and weapons are filled in. The random feature fills in most of the information for you
and randomly generates Race(PHB so far), Class (including extended subclasses), Level, Background (including extended 
backgrounds), Experience, etc.

Your characters can be saved if the Character Name field is filled in properly. To load a character, fill in the Character Name
field and then tap the "Load" button.

Thanks and happy gaming!
